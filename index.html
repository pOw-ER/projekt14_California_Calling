        <h2>Stuck in the middle.</h2>
        <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the California
          Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.</p>

        <p>Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters will be available for purchase at our exclusive pop-up
          shop during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose what amount to donate. All
          proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities that are still displaced.

          <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out
            stronger than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California poppy.
